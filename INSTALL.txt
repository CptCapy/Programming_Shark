Some notes on the compilation and installation of the Shark
libraries, served chilled. If something goes wrong remember:
It's not the bite, it's the fight!

For an overview about all references and manuals attached to this Shark 
distribution please refer to the file "doc/index.html".

If you have no idea how to install a library from sources
you will probabily find the Shark installation tutorials at
    doc/tutorials/Install/index.html        (Unix/Linux/Mac OS)
    doc/tutorials/InstallWin/index.html     (Windows)
helpful. They give step-by-step explanations of the commands
involved with additional helpful comments.


Unix/Linux/Mac/compatible:
--------------------------

####### Compilation
#

The Shark library uses the GNU "autoconf" tool to create a top-level
Makefile. Run "autoconf" in the Shark-directory; this will generate a
configure-script from the "configure.in" file. For convenience Shark
comes with a ready-made configure script. So, if you do not have
autoconf installed you can try to just skip this step.

Run the configure script, i.e., do something like "./configure". This
will produce the top-level Makefile from the "Makefile.in" template,
as well as several other Makefiles hidden in sub-directories.

Run "make libs" to compile the library and "make all" to compile and
install the library and to compile the examples.

To sum up, the whole procedure should be as easy as:

> autoconf (if available)
> ./configure
> make libs (make all)

or simply say:
> ./installShark
This script summarizes the Shark installation as described above.

Make sure to include Shark in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
variable or run
> make install
as a root user to install Shark to a central path.


####### Makefile Rules
#

The top-level Makefile comes with various rules intended to ease
compilation and installation of the Shark library. Before you even
consider digging into the details of the Makefile, just try saying
"make" in the Shark-directory to get a concise list of the
available commands.

Anyway, for a quick start it should suffice to say "make libs" in
the Shark-directory.



Windows:
--------

There are "*.dsp" files (Visual Studio 6.0 project files) for
the Shark library and each example program shipped with Shark.
These project files are accompanied by a set of "*.dsw" (Visual
Studio 6.0 workspace files). In the Shark-directory there are the
basic workspace files "Shark_Libs.dsw" and "Shark_All.dsw" which
contain the projects for all libraries and for the libraries with
examples, respectively.

1. Shark_All.dsw     Will create the release and debug versions
                     of all libraries and example programs.
2. Shark_Libs.dsw    Will create the release and debug versions
                     of all libraries.

Choose the batch creation when compiling.
Versions later than 6.0 of the IDE support the automated conversion
of project and workspace files into more recent formats.

After compilation you will find the directories "lib/WinNT/Release"
and/or "lib/WinNT/Debug" in the root directory of Shark, containing
the release and debug versions of the library.
The directory "win_tmp" will contain all temporary files created by
the Visual C++ compiler.
The executable example programs can be found in the "examples"
directory, located in the sub-directories of the corresponding
packages.
